Traffic lane detection from car camera footage

As a part of a university subject called Project Lab I worked on image/video processing and machine
vision problems using OpenCV. Throughout the course I solved various smaller tasks involving
filtering, transformations, blob detection, moving object detection and image segmentation.
Using the here acquired knowledge I went on to make my independent project which processes car
camera footage and attempts to detect Traffic Lanes, this way being able to provide assistance to the driver in real time if needed.
